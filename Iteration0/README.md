# Task: Implement a Simple Echo Client-Server Application

## Objective
Choose a desirable programming language for implementation and create a simple Echo Client-Server application. This exercise will help you understand the basics of network programming and socket communication.

## Requirements
1. **Select a Programming Language**: Choose a programming language that you are comfortable with or want to learn. Common choices for network programming include Python, Java, C/C++, or any other language of your choice.

2. **Create a Server**: Implement a server program that listens for incoming client connections on a specific port (e.g., 8080).

3. **Create a Client**: Implement a client program that connects to the server on the specified port.

4. **Echo Functionality**: When a client sends a message to the server, the server should echo (send back) the same message to the client.

5. **Handle Multiple Clients (Optional)**: If you want to take it a step further, you can modify your server to handle multiple clients concurrently. Each client should be able to send messages independently.

6. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to gracefully handle situations like connection failures or unexpected client disconnections.

7. **Testing**: Test your Echo Client-Server application by running both the client and server programs. Ensure that messages sent from the client are correctly echoed back by the server.

## Tips
- You can find many tutorials and code examples online for creating Echo Client-Server applications in different programming languages. These resources can provide guidance and code samples.
- Familiarize yourself with socket programming concepts, as they are essential for network communication.
- Use the built-in networking libraries or modules available in your chosen programming language to create sockets, establish connections, and send/receive data.
- Start with a single-threaded implementation for simplicity. If you want to explore more advanced topics, you can later look into multi-threading or asynchronous programming.
- Don't forget to close sockets and free up resources when the communication is finished.

**Note:** This task is an excellent way to gain hands-on experience with network programming and can be a valuable addition to your portfolio if you're learning or working in the field of software development or networking.
